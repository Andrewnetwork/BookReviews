This website is a collection of book reviews written to help me better appreciate and connect with the books I read. Some are discursive free associations exploring various thoughts stimulated by the work and others are traditionally structured around a thesis. 

I've lost a lot of time to mindlessly watching screens. My newfound commitment to reading, and writing about what I read, is an attempt to reclaim my inner life which has been so viciously intruded upon by the insidious contrivances of the modern world.
