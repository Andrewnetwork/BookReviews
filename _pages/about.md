This website is a collection of book reviews written to help me better appreciate and connect with the books I read. Some are discursive free associations exploring various thoughts stimulated by the work and others are traditionally structured around a thesis. 

I've lost a lot of time to mindlessly watching screens. My newfound commitment to reading, and writing about what I read, is an attempt to reclaim my inner life which has been so viciously intruded upon by the insidious contrivances of the modern world.  

Please leave a comment if you'd like to give me feedback or if any content interests you. 

P.S. The site name, psydef.net, stands for *psychological defense*. I purchased the domain because I once planned on creating a website about the negative psychological influences of technology and propaganda, but that project never came to fruition. The domain is now used to point to my book reviews hosted on github. Given that reading seems to be the antidote to the malignant influences I had previously desired to advocate against, perhaps the original intent which motivated my purchase of the domain is still serviced by the content now hosted here.
