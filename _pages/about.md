Writing about what one reads is the best way to fully process it. This website is a collection of book reviews that I've written to help me better appreciate and connect with the books I read. 

I'm currently working on my first novel and reading widely has helped me refine my writing. I'm committed to reading because I'm committed to writing. This site is a product of this commitment. 

I hope you enjoy my amateur literary criticism. Please leave a comment if you'd like to give me feedback or if any content interests you.
