Published in 1987, Bram Stoker's *Dracula* is a Victorian era tale of a Romanian vampire who plots to haunt the teeming population of industrial London, but is thwarted when his vampiric assault on a well-connected lawyer, who assisted him in procuring property in London, leads him and his associates to chase Dracula back to Romania and destroy him on the precipice of his escape. <!--more-->

Famous books are hard to review properly because the expectations set by their fame well exceed any soberly formed expectations. *Dracula* faces a further challenge because not only is the book famous, but the eponymous main character has become synonymous with vampire. I therefore expected this book to be a sort of grand source book for vampirism, but what I found was mostly a long and rather boring Victorian era detective novel with a little vampire stuff thrown in here and there. If I had the power to rename this book in order to have it reflect my experience of reading it, I would name it *Chasing After Dracula*.
